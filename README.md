To create a new remote project on Github without visiting the Github website, you can use the Github API and make a RESTful POST request using a command line tool such as cURL. Here's an example:

Open your terminal or command prompt
Navigate to the directory where your project is located using the cd command
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using git init
Add all the files in your project to the repository using git add .
Commit the changes to the repository using git commit -m "Initial Commit"
Obtain a personal access token (PAT) from Github by following the instructions here
Create a new repository on Github using the following cURL command:
ruby
Copy code
curl -u <Username>:<PAT> -X POST https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"<RepositoryName>"}'
Replace <Username> with your Github username, <PAT> with your personal access token, and <RepositoryName> with the name you want to give to your Github repository.

Link your local repository to the remote repository on Github using git remote add origin https://github.com/<Username>/<RepositoryName>.git
Push the code to the remote repository using git push -u origin master
